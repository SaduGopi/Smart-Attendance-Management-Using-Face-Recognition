# Smart Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition

## 📌 Description
This project is an AI-based attendance system that uses real-time face recognition to automatically mark attendance. It helps prevent proxy attendance and reduces manual work in educational institutions or corporate settings.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier
- NumPy
- CSV for data storage

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Automatic attendance marking with timestamp
- Stores attendance data in CSV format
- Easy to use and extendable for GUI integration

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python attendance.py
   ```
4. The webcam will open — stand in front of it and your attendance will be marked.

## 📂 Output
- The system generates an `attendance.csv` file with Name, Date, and Time of each recognized individual.
